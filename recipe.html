        <h2>Tips & Notes</h2>
        <p>For the <strong>most authentic Nigerian style</strong>, don't be afraid to let the noodles get slightly crispy in the pan - this adds great texture! The key is balancing the vegetables with the noodles. Many Nigerians add <em>corned beef or canned sardines</em> for extra protein and flavor. Adjust the scotch bonnet pepper to your heat preference, and always serve immediately while hot for the best experience!</p>
